On March 6, 2022, Ronin -- an Ethereum-linked blockchain platform for a play-to-earn nonfungible token game Axie Infinity -- was breached, resulting 173,600 Ether tokens (worth approximately $520 million at the time), along with $25,5 million USDÐ¡, drained from the platform. The attackers managed to get access to four validator nodes using hacked private keys along with a third-party validator, which made five validator signatures needed to recognize an event.
