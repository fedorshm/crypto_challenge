On March 23, 2022, Ronin -- an Ethereum-linked blockchain platform for a play-to-earn nonfungible token game Axie Infinity -- was breached, resulting in 173,600 Ether tokens (worth approximately $520 million at the time), along with $25,5 million USDС, drained from the platform. The attackers managed to get access to four validator nodes by approaching an Axie Infinity engineer who went through a fake lucrative job application process and downloaded a spyware pdf file, which gave the hackers four private keys (out of five needed). Then, gaining access to a third-party validator, they received the fifth validator signature needed to recognize an event. The address involved in the hack is 0x098B716B8Aaf21512996dC57EB0615e2383E2f96. The FBI tied the North Korean hacker organization Lazarus Group to the attack. 

After the hack, the attackers swapped the stolen USDC for Ether and began to launder the Ether via three centralized exchanges, as well as sending funds to a popular currency mixer service Tornado Cash. They were able to extract roughly $200 million. The U.S. government recovered around $30 million worth of the stolen tokens. 

On June 6, 2022, the Ronin bridge was reopened with improved security measures (increased number of validators and software update).

On February 2, 2022, Wormhole -- a token bridge between Ethereum and Solana -- suffered a loss of of 120,000 Wrapped Ether tokens (worth $321 million at the time) as a result of a security flaw exploit. The attacker used an update to the project's GitHub repository which revealed a fix to a bug that had not been deployed to the project itself, which allowed the attacker to forge a valid signature for a transaction and mint 120,000 of Wrapped Ether without inputting an equivalent amount. 

Following the attack, the Wormhole team contacted the hacker, presenting them a bug bounty of $10 million for exploit details and returning what had been minted. The offer was ignored. The attacker's ETH wallet to which the stolen tokens were moved is 0x629e7da20197a5429d30da36e77d06cdf796b71a. 

The funds were later replaced by Jump Crypto, which was involved in the development of the Wormhole protocol. 

On February 24, 2022, Jump Crypto and Oasis (a privately owned app deployed on top of decentralized finance protocol MakerDAO) counter-exploited the attacker and retrieved $218 million as per an order from the High Court of England and Wales.
