On March 23, 2022, Ronin -- an Ethereum-linked blockchain platform for a play-to-earn nonfungible token game Axie Infinity -- was breached, resulting in 173,600 Ether tokens (worth approximately $520 million at the time), along with $25,5 million USDÐ¡, drained from the platform. The attackers managed to get access to four validator nodes by approaching an Axie Infinity engineer who went through a fake lucrative job application process and downloaded a spyware pdf file, which gave the hackers four private keys (out of five needed). Then, gaining access to a third-party validator, they received the fifth validator signature needed to recognize an event. The address involved in the hack is 0x098B716B8Aaf21512996dC57EB0615e2383E2f96. The FBI tied the North Korean hacker organization Lazarus Group to the attack. 

After the hack, the attackers swapped the stolen USDC for Ether and began to launder the Ether via three centralized exchanges, as well as sending funds to currency mixer services such as Tornado Cash. They were able to extract roughly $200 million. The U.S. government recovered around $30 million worth of the stolen tokens. 

On June 6, 2022, the Ronin bridge was reopened with improved security measures (increased number of validators and software update).
